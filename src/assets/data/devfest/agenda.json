That's the benefit of \"Testing\". But the \"Automated\" part is more important. You can imagine Automated Testing as the process of building a robot (Let's call him Baymax) that sits down and goes through all the features of your app and notifies you if something is not behaving as it should. And the best part of having Baymax in your team is that he can go through your app way faster than you or your team can. On a large project, Baymax may take a few minutes if not seconds to go through thousands of features while it will take your QA team weeks if not months to do the same.",
